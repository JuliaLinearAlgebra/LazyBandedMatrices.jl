This package supports lazy banded and block-banded matrices, for example, a lazy multiplication of banded matrices:

```julia
julia> using LazyBandedMatrices, LazyArrays, BandedMatrices

julia> A = brand(10,10,1,1);

julia> ApplyMatrix(*, A, A)
10×10 ApplyArray{Float64,2,typeof(*),Tuple{BandedMatrix{Float64,Array{Float64,2},Base.OneTo{Int64}},BandedMatrix{Float64,Array{Float64,2},Base.OneTo{Int64}}}}:
